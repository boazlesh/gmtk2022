## Active screen
In the battle screen you move around a 9x9 grid and your enemies move around theirs.
At any point you may move to an open slot next to you, but when you do you are rolled so the top face changes accordingly.
The top face of the player determines what color is currently equipped. The player gets 3 colors.
When the player attacks using a color it uses up the attack he brought from the custom screen.
After the player uses all of their attacks, they have to wait for the next turn.
While the turn is going there's a custom gauge filling.
When it's filled the next turn begins and the player goes back to the custom screen.

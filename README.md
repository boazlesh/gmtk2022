You are a die. the enemies are dice. You shoot dice. You pick attacks using dice. Everything is dice.

Game is a battle scene like MMBN - The custom (customize) screen, and the action screen.

## Custom screen
In the custom screen, you are presented with 6 possible attacks.
You have to choose (color) 3 different attack to take with you into the action screen.
For each color you roll a D6 which determines the potency of the attack.
For each color you may enhance the original roll with additional ones, with the new color's value being the sum of all rolls.
If the sum goes over 6, the color is bust and you lose it for this round.

## Battle screen
In the battle screen you move around a 9x9 grid and your enemies move around theirs.
At any point you may move to an open slot next to you, but when you do you are rolled so the top face changes accordingly.
The top face of the player determines what color is currently equipped. The player gets 3 colors.
When the player attacks using a color it uses up the attack he brought from the custom screen.
After the player uses all of their attacks, they have to wait for the next turn.
While the turn is going there's a custom gauge filling.
When it's filled the next turn begins and the player goes back to the custom screen.
